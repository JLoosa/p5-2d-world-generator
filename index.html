      <h3>How to use this application:</h3>
      <p>
        This program is built on top of a JavaScript library named "p5" and uses the aforementioned library to create
        2D world renderings. To this end, a few options have been provided for the user to customise the world. The
        first is the ability to specify a "seed" for the underlying Perlin noise function. The next is a "scale" that
        is also applied to the Perlin noise function. With these two features, the user can generate any number of 2D
        worlds that they can use for any purpose they choose. To make using the worlds more accessible, a button has
        been added that will download the current view of the world to the user's computer.

        <b>[2020-08-23]</b>
        This is an attempt at making a 2-dimensional "world" generator.
        It is not meant to be complex or have much configurability as it is only a proof-of-concept.
        An extension of this idea is that, as of the time of current implementation, the code all exists in a single file
        and is incredibly messy. If I have the time and motivation in the future, I may revisit this project and organize
        it to be more customizable, have various Quality of Life features, and utilize JavaScript more effectively (such
        as by splitting the project into multiple files, or taking more advantage of JS's object/dictionary systems.)
